           <p>This was a really interesting assignment. I decided to choose Dracula because I figured it would have a lot of visuals that could be translated well into emojis. Overall, there were a few struggles with getting everything to work, especially having to learn everything online instead of in and in-class setting. I've honestly never read Dracula, but this assignment gave me quite the interest in it. After creating Dracul-emoji, I definitely want to give the original a read!</p>

     <p>3rd May. Bistriz-Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late.</p>
     <p>&#127747;&#128515;&#128064;&#128642;&#128099;</p>
     <p>Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets.</p>
     <p>&#128534;&#127980;&#128344;</p>
     <p> I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible</p>
     <p>&#128072;&#128073;&#128563;&#127754;&#129411;</p>
     <p>The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.</p>
     <p>&#128336;&#127770;&#127974;</p>
     <p>We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale.</p>
     <p>&#128020;&#127813;&#129316;&#128553;</p>
     <p>I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (Mem., get recipe for Mina.)</p>
     <p>&#129333;&#127831;&#127869;&#128507;</p>
     <p> I asked the waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians.</p>
     <p>&#128068;&#127867;&#128077;</p>
     <p>I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.</p>
     <p>&#8986;&#127905;&#127983;&#128214;&#128506;&#129499;</p>
     <p>Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania.</p>
